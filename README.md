## What is React ?
* Open source library for building User Interface.
* There are two key point in the definition.

* Facebook uses this library for own products and invest money and resources to keep the project alive and you can be rest assured it is not going to die down any time soon.
* More than 100k stars on Github and Huge community behind it.

## Component Based Architecture
* React is component based architecture.
* This lets you breakdown the application  into small encapsulated parts which can be composed to make more complex UI.\

## React is declarative 
* Tell React what you want and React will build the actual UI.
* React will handle effeciently updating and rendering of the components.
* DOM updates are handles gracefully in React.
